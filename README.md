# Quest-Calendars-Helper
This project is designed to be a companion for any year of Queat Calendars or multiple, if you wish.

To begin, navigate in Command Prompt or terminal to folder with all the python files and run the command 
python ~qc_helper_start.py

Navigation of menus is done primarily with numbers corresponding to the menu options, with occational yes/no questions answered as such.

If you want to create your own character, for now, you will need to modify the data/character.txt file with your character's stats traits, and abilities. I then recommend adding items, equipment, followers etc. through the app.

Things that still need to be done:
Creating new characters
Leveling up
Marking and refreshing per Page and Per Rest ability uses
Configuring a preset year with the character so that users arent asked for a specific year every time they want to get something.
Limiting Menu options in accordance witb that preset year.
