# Quest-Calendars-Helper
This project is designed to be a companion for any year of Queat Calendars or multiple, if you wish.

This project was developed with Python version 3.12.10. while that version may not be required. an installation of Python is. if you do not have Python installed, please do.

To begin, download the sorce code by clicking the green coad button on the repository landing page, and download as a zip file. Extract the zip file in your desired loacation.
Next, open Command Prompt or Terminal and navigate to the folder with all the python files and run the command 
`python ~qc_helper_start.py`
Alternatively, you may just be able to double click on ~qc_helper_start.py in explorer, but I've had mixed results trying to open python files that way.

Navigation of menus is done primarily with numbers corresponding to the menu options, with occational yes/no questions answered as such.

If you want to create your own character, for now, you will need to modify the data/character.txt file with your character's stats traits, and abilities. I then recommend adding items, equipment, followers etc. through the app.

Things that still need to be done:  
Creating new characters  
Leveling up  
Marking and refreshing per Page and Per Rest ability uses  
Configuring a preset year with the character so that users arent asked for a specific year every time they want to get something.  
Limiting Menu options in accordance with that preset year.
