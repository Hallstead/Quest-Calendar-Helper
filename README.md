# Quest-Calendar-Helper
This project is designed to be a companion for any year of Queat Calendars or multiple, if you wish.

To begin, navigate in Command Prompt or terminal to folder with all the python files and run the command 
python ~qc_helper_start.py

Navigation of menus is done primarily with numbers corresponding to the menu options, with occational yes/no questions answered as such.
